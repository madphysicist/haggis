    Create a class decorator that sets a pre-defined version of
    :py:meth:`~object.__setattr__` that forbids write access to the
    attributes of a class.

    Access to properties may be allowed through `allow_properties`.
    The default setting of :py:obj:`True` does not guarantee that
    properties will be acessible, just that the parent implementation
    of :py:meth:`~object.__setattr__` will be responsible for handling
    the access.

    The messages of exceptions that are raised are based on the type of
    access that is requested. They mimic the default message that appear
    from most Python classes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    allow_properties : bool
        Whether or not to make an exception for properties. If
        :py:obj:`True`, setting of properties will be delegated to the
        parent's :py:meth:`~object.__setattr__`.
    docstring : str
        The string to associate with :py:meth:`~object.__setattr__`\ 's
        `__doc__` attibute.

    Return
    ------
    decorator : callable
        A class decorator that inserts a :py:meth:`~object.__setattr__`
        function into the decorated class.

def grouper(iterable, n, tail=True, fillvalue=None):
    """
    Gather an iterable into chunks or blocks of fixed length.

    Based on ``grouper`` from :ref:`itertools-recipes`. The main
    difference is that this implementation allows the final chunk to
    contain fewer elements. This version also returns lazy iterables for
    the inner chunks, unlike the ``grouper`` recipe which returns
    chunks.

    By default, the iterator assumes that all of the elements of a group
    have been consumed by the caller. If this is not the case, the next
    group will start with the un-consumed segment. An easy way to
    guarantee proper consumption is to use :py:func:`consume`.

    Inspired by https://stackoverflow.com/a/23926929/2988730.

    Parameters
    ----------
    iterable : iterable
        The iterable to split.
    n : int
        The size of the chunks to split into.
    tail : bool
        If :py:obj:`True`, the final group may contain fewer than `n`
        elements. If :py:obj:`False`, `fillvalue` will be used to pad
        the last group if it turns out to be shorter than `n`.
    fillvalue :
        The item to pad the final chunk with if `tail` is
        :py:obj:`False` and the iterable's length is not a multiple of
        `n`.

    Yields
    ------
    group :
        An iterable containing the next `n` or fewer elements of
        `iterable`.

    Notes
    -----

    A generator that returns the length of each element of `iterable` in

    Each element must be an iterable itself. `seq_type` controls the
    type of sequence the elements will be turned into to get the length.
    If `None`, elements are assumed to have a `len` and will not be
    altered. Otherwise, `seq_type` must be a callable that accepts one
    iterable argument and returns a valid sequence, like
    :py:class:`list`, :py:class:`tuple`, :py:class:`str` or
    :py:class:`bytearray`.

    Specifying `seq_type` is roughly equivalent to calling
    ``lenumerate(map(seq_type, iterable))``. It guarantees consumption
    of all the elements of the sub-iterables. This could be important
