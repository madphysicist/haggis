def ensure_extension(name, ext, partial_policy=None, partial_limit=None):
    """
    Verify that the name ends with the required extension, and
    update it if not.

    `name` is assumed to be a string. `ext` is the desired suffix,
    usually beginning with ``'.'``. If `name` aleady ends with `ext`,
    return it as-is. If not, the extension will either be appended or
    completed depending on `partial_policy` and `partial_limit`. The
    first character of `ext` is treated as the separator character. It
    must appear in `name` for any of the completions to work.

    Recognized values for `partial_policy` are as follows (case
    insensitive):

        :py:obj:`None`, ``'none'``, ``''``
            No partial extensions are recognized. If ``name='a.xls'``
            and ``ext='.xlsx'``, the result is ``'a.xls.xlsx'``.
            Similarly, for ``'b.jpg'``, ``'.jpeg'``, the result is
            ``'b.jpg.jpeg'``.
        ``'append'``, ``'+'``
            Existing extension can be extended by at most
            `partial_limit` characters to acheive the target. If
            ``name='a.xls'`` and ``ext='.xlsx'``, the result is
            ``'a.xlsx'``. However, for ``'b.jpg'``, ``'.jpeg'``, the
            result is ``'b.jpg.jpeg'``.
        ``'insert'``, ``'^'``
            Existing extension can have up to `partial_limit` characters
            inserted anywhere to achieve the target. If ``name='a.xls'``
            and ``ext='.xlsx'``, the result is ``'a.xlsx'``. Similarly,
            for ``'b.jpg'``, ``'.jpeg'``, the result is ``b.jpeg``.
        ``'strip'``, ``'-'``
            The existing extension may be loner than the desired one, so
            up to `partial_limit` characters may be stripped off the end
            to match the target. If ``name='a.xlsx'`` and
            ``ext='.xls'``, the result is ``'a.xls'``. However, for
            ``'b.jpeg'``, ``'.jpg'``, the result is ``'b.jpeg.jpg'``.
        ``'remove'``, ``'x'``
            The existing extension may be longer than the desired one,
            so removing up to `partial_limit` characters anywhere in the
            name is allowed. If ``name='b.jpeg'`` and ``ext='.jpg'``,
            the result is ``'b.jpg'``. However, for ``name='b.jpg'`` and
            ``ext='.jpeg'``, the result is ``'b.jpg.jpeg'``.
        ``'replace'``, ``'r'``
            Replace any existing extension with the provided one.
        ``'create'``, ``'c'``
            Create the extension only if one does not already exist.

    `partial_limit` determines the maximum number of characters that can
    be modified to achieve the target. If :py:obj:`None` or a number
    greater than the length of `ext` mean "any number". If zero, the
    result is the same as for `partial_policy='none'` regardless of the
    actual value of `partial_policy`, unless `partial_policy` is
    ``'replace'``, which completely ignores the limit.

        characters. This means that the name can be appended/inserted to
        to get the desired extension.

        If `longer` is `False`, the sense of the comparison is reversed:
