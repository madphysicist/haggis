    Load Python module code as a dictionary.

    This function is intended to support the loading of configuration
    files that use valid Python code into a dictionary. The loaded
    module will not be inserted into :py:data:`sys.modules`.

    Basic filtering of the loaded namespace is supported: dunder
    attributes and imported modules are omitted from the final result by
    default. This behavior can be altered with the `skip_dunder` and
    `skip_modules` parameters, respectively.

    A reference can be injected into the loaded module *before* its
    code is run (i.e., making it available to the module code) using
    the `injection` and `injection_var` parameters. `injection` is the
    data itself. It is never inspected or modified in any way.
    `injection_var` names the module attribute that `injection` will
    be bound to. If the module defines a variable with the same name as
    `injection_var`, the injected reference will have no effect.

    If a loaded module contains an attribute named by the
    `include_var` parameter, it must be a sequence of paths or
    strings. All names in the sequence will be loaded recursively into
    the same dictionary as well. Includes will be loaded and parsed with
    the same parameters as the root file (except for `name` and possibly
    `injection_var`), in breadth-first order. Successive levels do *not*
    override values set by the root module that this function is called
    with. In the model for which this function was developed,
    configuration files can reference and override default static
    configurations provided externally through include files.

    Parameters
    ----------
    module : str or pathlib.Path
        The path of the module to load.
    name : str or None
        The name under which the module is imported (its `__name__`
        attribute). If not supplied, or a falsy value, the name is
        computed from the file name, minus the extension. Setting this
        parameter to ``'__main__'`` will trigger import guards.
    injection :
        Any object that the user wishes to inject into the loading
        process. The object is visible to the code of the module
        under the name given by `injection_var`.
    injection_var : str or None
        The name of an attribute to inject into the loading process.
        The `injection` object is bound to this name the in the module
        namespace. The value of `injection` is never inspected. It is
        injected or omitted based solely on the contents of this
        parameter. A falsy value (the default) skips injection.
    recurse_injection : bool
        Whether or not to provide `injection` to recursively loaded
        modules (based on `include_var`). If recursion is enabled (the
        default), the same variable name is reused.
    include_var : str or None
        The name of the attribute to look into to find additional
        include files. Defaults to ``'__include_files__'``. If Falsy,
        do not recurse.
    skip_dunders : bool
        Whether or not to skip attributes starting with a double
        underscore (``__``) when converting to a dictionary. Defaults to
        :py:obj:`True`.
    skip_modules : bool
        Whether or not to skip module objects that are found in the
        loaded namespace when converting to a dictionary. Defaults to
        :py:obj:`True`.
    skip_classes : bool
        Whether or not to skip class objects that are found in the
        loaded namespace when converting to a dictionary. Defaults to
        :py:obj:`False`.
    skip_functions : bool
        Whether or not to skip function objects that are found in the
        loaded namespace when converting to a dictionary. Defaults to
        :py:obj:`False`.
    """
    def parse_module(mod, output, submodules):
        """
        Append the contents of the module's dictionary to an existing
        dictionary of key-value pairs.

        Modules and keys beginning with double underscore (``__``) can
        be filteres. Keys are *not* overriden in the output. Duplicates
        are discarded from the module being loaded and not overwritten.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mod : ModuleType
            The module to parse.
        output : dict
