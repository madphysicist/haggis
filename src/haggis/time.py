    Rough lightweight timer context manager.

    This is not intended to be used for precise benchmarking, but can
    give a good idea of how long operations in a `with` block take.

    The context manager can be reused as many times as necessary. When
    first created, it reports time relative to its creation time,
    unless specifically requested otherwise.

    .. py:attribute:: start

       The start time of the stopwatch, as a floating point timestamp
       from Epoch (see :py:func:`time.time`). This is valid regardless
       of whether the stopwatch is running or not.

    .. py:attribute:: end

       The end time of the stopwatch, as a floating point timestamp
       from Epoch (see :py:func:`time.time`). If the stopwatch is
       running, this is set to None. If it is stopped or paused, this
       attribute records the time of the stop or pause.

    .. py:attribute:: pauses

       A sequence containing ``(start, end)`` tuples for every pause
       triggered since the last restart. The last element may be a
       placeholder object if the stopwatch is paused. All tuple
       elements have units of seconds from Epoch (see
       :py:func:`time.time`).

    .. py:attribute:: pause_duration

       The sum of the durations of all the pauses, in seconds.

    This class is not thread safe.

        This method returns a context manager. Entering the context
        manager does nothing, but exiting it unpauses this timer.

        Calling this method multiple times without unpausing will
        lead to potentially unexpected behavior. All context managers
        returned by this method unpause the stopwatch. That means, for
        example, that nesting context managed calls to :py:meth:`pause`
        will unpause when the innermost context manager exits, not the
        outermost.
