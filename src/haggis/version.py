"""
:py:mod:`haggis.version` holds the version of the package.

The actual version number is normally exported through the top-level
:py:mod:`haggis` package, but defined here. This module exists to
facilitate deployment and testing, so users do not need to install the
entire package to get the version number.

Bump the version in the dev branch every time a prior version is tagged
in master. Unless a major rewrite is planned, the new version should
increment the minor number. The new version should be a release
candidate, and have the corresponding `rc1` suffix. All following
commits belong to the new version. Bump to full version immediately
before merging with master. A tag is assigned on the master commit that
merges in dev. Bump the version in dev immediately after merging master
back in.
